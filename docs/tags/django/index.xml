      <description>Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) is an AWS product that enables you to send marketing or transactional emails to your users. I’ve used it to send transactional emails, which are emails that are sent to a user following a transaction or an action, like signing up or requesting a password reset. Typically they come from a ‘noreply’ email address because you cannot reply to them. They’re very useful and should definitely be a component of your app.</description>

      <description>Have you ever needed to do something over and over and over again with your data in Django? Perhaps you wanted to summarize your data. Maybe you needed to send some reminder emails. Regardless, as you get deeper and deeper into building apps with Django, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to start automating some tasks.
When I first looked into doing this, Celery was nearly always the top result. I added it to my Django project and tried to get it up and running.</description>
