      <description>For a while, I created my own test data, manually, in every single test. It was tedious and took a bit of creative energy because I also tried to make the test data Stars Wars themed ðŸ˜…. Eventually I came across some data that was a bit too tedious for me to create on my own and I decided that it was time to start generating it. And it was actually incredibly easy to implement, and I&amp;rsquo;ll never manually create test data again!</description>

      <description>Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) is an AWS product that enables you to send marketing or transactional emails to your users. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it to send transactional emails, which are emails that are sent to a user following a transaction or an action, like signing up or requesting a password reset. Typically they come from a &amp;lsquo;noreply&amp;rsquo; email address because you cannot reply to them. They&amp;rsquo;re very useful and should definitely be a component of your app.</description>
