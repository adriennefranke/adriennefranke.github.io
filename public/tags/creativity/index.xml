      <description>I love music. It&amp;rsquo;s been a big part of my life since I was little. First, I begrudgingly learned piano. Then I moved on to the guitar. Eventually I learned the bass, the drums, the upright bass (classical), and a couple more instruments. Long story short, I have been playing music for nearly two decades and I know a whole band&amp;rsquo;s worth of instruments decently well.
It&amp;rsquo;s easier than ever to record, produce, and release music as an independent musician nowadays.</description>
