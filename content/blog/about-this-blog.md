## About Me
I'm a software engineer and analytics leader with extensive experience in web development, automation, data science, and analytics. I'm energized by tough technical challenges and aspire to build happy, well functioning teams. I enjoy trying out new technologies, mentoring others, and speaking at tech conferences. 

## About This Blog
This is a space for me, and anyone else who might find the writing useful. I compile information that I know I'll need to find again. I use it as a place to get my thoughts out of my head and onto a page. This blog is mostly technical, but sometimes I write about other stuff.

Thanks for stopping by!
